When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your 
work local?

When working on a project with multiple contributors, or when I want to push 
work done on another computer.



Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git 
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Another contributor may have altered the remote repo, so pulling those changes 
may interfere with whatever I'm working on locally.
