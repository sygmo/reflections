When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your 
work local?

When working on a project with multiple contributors, or when I want to push 
work done on another computer.



Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git 
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Another contributor may have altered the remote repo, so pulling those changes 
may interfere with whatever I'm working on locally.



Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Fork - used to create your own version of a public repo
Clone - copy of a repo on the local directory
Branch - used to create experimental features
