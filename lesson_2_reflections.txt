What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Initializing a repository creates a default repo with no commits. Creating
one will allow current and future versions of the code to be saved.


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the 
repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area contains files that have not yet been added or synced to the
repository, but does not necessarily contain all updated files from the
working directory. This is helpful, because it allows you to choose which 
files you want to sync and which you don't.
