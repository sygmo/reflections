What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Initializing a repository creates a default repo with no commits. Creating
one will allow current and future versions of the code to be saved.



How is the staging area different from the working directory and the 
repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area contains files that have not yet been added or synced to the
repository, but does not necessarily contain all updated files from the
working directory. This is helpful, because it allows you to choose which 
files you want to sync and which you don't.



How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per
logical change?

You can check to be sure that you're not commiting too many files at once.
Also, diff --staged can be used to check the changes made with the most
recent commit in the repository.



What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your
history organized? How would branches help?

Branches would help if I wanted to create an experimental new feature, but
I still want to keep a working version of the code I've already written.
Branches allow me to commit code based on the master branch without actually
altering the master branch.
